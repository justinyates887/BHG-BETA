# Introduction

### Welcome to the Official Blue Haired Girl repo!

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to the project. It's people like you that will help make the Blue Haired Girl such a great bot.

### If you want to contribute, you MUST follow these guidelines.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### If you've found a bug or have an idea, contribute!

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or developing features are all examples of helpful contributions.

> The Blue Haired Girl is an open source project, and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the BLue Haired Girl herself.

### Please do not submit any unfinished or broken features, or features that will violate Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Check whether the #FAQ or #Bugs channel in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FqbRWkgfcT) can help with your issue. If your problem is not strictly Blue Haired Girl specific, [SmallBlue Dev](https://discord.gg/xHYUwSgpwQ) server may be able to help.

# Ground Rules
### Please adhere to the Code of Conduct.

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure code is functioning in all aspects before creating a push.
> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to BHG? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### New to Open-Source?
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can try: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### Submitting a Contribution.

* Test your feature or bug fix by forking this code, including your code, and creating your own bot token. Once tests pass you can create a request.
* Make sure you include a DETAILED description of what you've changed and why.

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Note the Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request.

### Small Contributions.

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Security Risk

> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email SmallBlueDev@protonmail.com instead.

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to SmallBlueDev@protonmail.com
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org.

### Bug Reports.

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Node are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> General questions should go to the #bugs on our Discord Server. The devs there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### Philosophy.

> Our philosophy is to provide servers with an all-encompasing server administration and user quality of life bot.
>
> We wish for more features to be included in a single bot to help reduce bot clutter in servers without having to pay significantly.

### Suggesting a Feature.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in the Blue Haired Girl, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that BHG has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within a few weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community

> You can chat with the core team on [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/FqbRWkgfcT).

# Code, commit message and labeling conventions

### Please follow the conventions you see present in the codebase.

### Your commit messages should be detailed.

### Please label issues properly.
